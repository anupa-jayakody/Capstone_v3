        ## How did Flavor Fuze cook?? :green_apple:

        - First I cleaned data using NLP data processing methods.
        - Then I tried different models and evaluated the results.
        - Then I picked NLP Word2Vec and FunkSVD models for the final solution.
        - Next I developed the Recommender System.
        - Finally I developed the customer application using Streamlit.
